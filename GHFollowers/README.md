# App Premise:

- The user can enter a GitHub username and retrieve a list of that username's followers.
- The user can search within these followers for a specific follower.
- The user is able to tap on a follower from that list to get more information about that follower. 
- The user is able to save favorite username searches so they donâ€™t have to type them every time. This needs to persist between app launches.
- 100% programmatic UI - No Storyboard
- No 3rd Party Libraries



# Details:

- Use the GitHub API
    - Followers endpoint - https://developer.github.com/v3/users/followers/
    - User info endpoint - https://developer.github.com/v3/users/
